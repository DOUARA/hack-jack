## Operating System 
No high-level program can run in a computer without having some kind of an operating system supporting it in the back.
in this project we develop a basic operating system that's composed of several modules: 

- Math
- Screen
- Output
- Array
- String
- Memory
- Keyboard 
- Sys

It's called the jack operating system, and it's written in jack 

As performance matters in an operating system, we've used numerous fast algorithms with logarithmic execution time in Math and Screen modules
