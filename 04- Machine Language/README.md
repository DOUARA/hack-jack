## Machine Langugae 
The machine language is defined by the set of binary instructions that the corresponded hardware can take and execute, it is the point where the abstract thoughts of the programmer as manifested in Symbolic Instructions ( Assembly ) are turned into physical operations performed in silicon. 
The machine language can be viewed as an agreed-upon formalism designed to manipulate a memory using a processor and a set of registers. 

Our machine language, the hack language, consists of two main instructions A and C, the A instruction is used to select certain register, the C instruction is used to perform logical and arithmetic operations and also could store the result in some register. 

## Assembly Language 
The assembly language is a direct mapping to the machine language, each one of the assembly instructions can be represented by exactly one instruction in machine code, it is used to make it easy for developers to code in machine language

## Hack Language specification



## Project 
To get used to assembly language, We've developed 2 basic assembly programs one to handle multiplication operation, the other to interact with the screen memory map.
