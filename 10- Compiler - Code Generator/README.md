## The Compiler ( Code Generator )
In this project we morpth the syntax analyzer we've built in the previous project to be a full compiler, instead of outputing an xml file,the compiler will generate a VM code that will be next taken by the VM translator and translated into machine code. 

## The project
In addition to the modules we already have we add one module: 
- **SymbolTable:** Responsible for tracking variables on the program. 

By the end of this project we've finished building the compiler for the Jack programming language.
