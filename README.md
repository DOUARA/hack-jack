## Hack-Jack, a Complete Computing System from the First Principals 
Hack-Jack is a serie of 11 projects that implements a computing system from the basic logic chips all the way up to building a compiler for a high-level language called jack and an operating system called jackOS, the design of the various layers of abstractions have been provided by **Shimon Schocken** and **Noam Nisan** on their famous courses, Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris [part-1 ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome) and [part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2/home/welcome) presented in coursera. 

As a self-taught developer and in the aim of developing a solid understanding of coumputer science fundamentals, I found this course very usefull and rewarding as it clarified many confusions I had about computers and software in a very elagant and concise way.

The projects are composed into 2 parts, Hardware (1-5), Software Hierarchy (6-11), in the hardware part w've used a basic Hardware description language designed by the instructors, and for the software I used python3 for all the proejcts that requires a third party language. 

### Hardware
1- Basic Logic Gates
2- The ALU chip
3- Memory Chip
4- Machine Language 
5- Computer Architecture 

### Software Hierarchy
6- Virtual Machine - Stack Arithmetic 
7- Virtual Machine - Program Control 
8- High-Level Language 
9-  Compiler - Syntax Analyzer 
10- Compiler - Code Generator 
11- Operating System 

I have provided a README file that explains each project separately, found on each project folder, I have also provided the notes that I was taking during the course.
