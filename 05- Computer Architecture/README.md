## Computer Architecture 
The computer as a multipurpose machine (machine that can act like any other machine) has been firstly described by [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) in his paper: [On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the ENTSCHEIDUNGS problem](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf)

Based on this description, Von Neumann has introduced a practical implementation later known as Von Neumann Architecture. 

In this project we use all the chips that we have built in the previous projects to build a computer based on the architecture of Von Neumann.
